<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<p>Light Up is played on a rectangular grid of white and black cells. The player places light bulbs in white cells such that no two bubles are in the same column or row if they are not seperated by a wall(with or without number). Bulb eluminates cells in row and coum it is placed until its light is blocked by a wall(black cell)</p>
<p>A black cell may have a number on it from 0 to 4 i, indicating how many bulbs must be placed adjacent to its four sides for example cell with number 3 must have 3 bulbs placed adjacent to its sides, and a cell with 0 cannoct have a bulb ext to any of its sides.<br>
An unnumered black cell may have any number of bulbs near.</p>

<h3 id="solution-methods">Solution methods</h3>
<p>A standard approach is firstly to put bulbs around cell with number 4 or smaller but surrander with andother walls - places where is only one configuration, after that other cells with numbers are taken under consideration.<br>
Another common technique is to look for a cell that is not yet lit and determine if there is only one possible cell in which bulb can be placed.</p>
